I am Russian, a citizen of the country that started the war in Ukraine and has continued it for more than 1,000 days. I am deeply opposed to this war, which I see as a violation of human rights and an affront to humanity. This perspective is deeply personal and informs every aspect of this project.</p><p>This project is my attempt to highlight the devastating human impact of war, to remind us that behind every number there are real people—women, children, and men—innocent civilians whose lives should not be lost to conflict. While I approached this work with empathy and respect, emphasizing the devastating human impact of war, it is important to note that this project cannot fully capture the scope or complexity of the events described.</p><p>As you view this work, please keep in mind that data visualisation, by its nature, is subjective. It is shaped by choices and limitations at every step, from collecting the data to conveying it through the visual form. Every effort has been made to verify the stories and associated numbers using multiple sources. However, due to the nature of war reporting, numbers may vary or change as new information emerges or reporting methodologies differ.</p><p>If you have any questions or thoughts, please feel free to reach out via email at <a href='mailto:anastasia.balagurova@gmail.com>' target='_blank'>anastasia.balagurova@gmail.com</a></p>",
