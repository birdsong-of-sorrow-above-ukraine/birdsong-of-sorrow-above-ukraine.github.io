Primary references include the annual reports of Human Rights Watch and the monthly publications of the OHCHR, which detail attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. Additionally, situation reports from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), along with news releases from Amnesty International and the World Health Organization (WHO), were used for the same purpose.</p><p>Individual stories were identified through journalistic investigations and field reports from sources such as The New York Times, Reuters, Associated Press, and BBC News, which provide on-the-ground reporting and firsthand testimonies. </p><p>For a full list of sources, please refer to the references section.</p>",

I was born and lived in Russia, and I am deeply opposed to the war that my country started and continues in Ukraine. This war destroys human lives and carries pain that cannot be justified.</p><p>This project is my attempt to capture the devastating consequences of the war and to emphasize that there are human lives behind every statistic. It is a place of mourning and remembrance for those whose lives were taken by the war.</p><p>As you view this work, please keep in mind that data visualisation, by its nature, is subjective. It is shaped by choices and limitations at every step, from collecting the data to conveying it through the visual form. Every effort has been made to verify the stories and associated numbers using multiple sources. However, due to the nature of war reporting, numbers may vary or change as new information emerges or reporting methodologies differ.</p><p>If you have any questions or thoughts, please feel free to reach out via email at <a href='mailto:anastasia.balagurova@gmail.com>' target='_blank'>anastasia.balagurova@gmail.com</a></p>",

Я родилась и жила в России, и я глубоко против войны, которую начала и ведет моя страна в Украине. Эта война разрушает человеческие жизни и несет в себе боль, которую нельзя оправдать.</p> <p>Этот проект — моя попытка зафиксировать непоправимые последствия войны и напомнить, что за каждой цифрой в отчетах скрываются живые люди. Это место скорби и памяти о тех, чьи жизни были оборваны войной.<p>Важно помнить, что любая визуализация данных по своей сути субъективна. Тем не менее, я сделала все возможное, чтобы представить информацию максимально точно и достоверно.
